			<h1>Where are the World’s Largest Refugee Camps?</h1>
		</div>
		<div id="panel">
			<p>The world is currently experiencing the highest levels of population displacement on record. Over 65.3 million people have been forced from their homes and more than half of those people are under the age of 18.</p>
			<p>Of the world’s 19.5 million refuges the vast majority live in urban environments, but this still leaves the 28% of refugees worldwide who live in a camp setting. This number increases to over 80% when one looks at only refugees in Africa.</p>
			<p>While refugee camps can be practical, encampment results in a range of problems for residents such as becoming dependent on aid and feelings of isolation. These concerns are easily exacerbated by overcrowding and a lack of infrastructure.</p>
